## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python >=3.12 (version specified in [.tool-versions](.tool-versions) recommended)
- Poetry ([installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hschickdevs/telegram-openai-agentkit.git
cd telegram-openai-agentkit

# Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY and TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN

# Run the bot
poetry run python -m src
```

## Usage

After starting the bot, see existing commands with `/help`.

### Create & Upload a Workflow:

1. Create a new workflow in the [OpenAI Agent Builder](https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder) tool.

    > Make sure to create an **End** node in your workflow, otherwise the responses will be empty. 

2. Once finished, click the **Code** button -> **Agents SDK** -> and copy the code snippet as **Python**:

    ![OpenAI Agent Builder Code Snippet](./docs/img/copy.png)

3. Save the code snippet as a `.py` or `.txt` file on your local machine (e.g., `my_workflow.py` or `my_workflow.txt`).

4. Use `/upload` in Telegram and send the file when prompted.

5. Give your workflow a name when prompted.

6. Once the workflow is registered, you can activate it with `/activate <workflow_name>`.

Chat normally after activating a workflow - it just works! üöÄ

## Development

### Running in Docker

> Ensure that you have set your environment variables in a `.env` file ([see above](#quick-start)).

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Code Quality Tools

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

#### Formatting with Black
```bash
# Format all Python files
poetry run black .

# Check formatting without making changes
poetry run black --check .
```

#### Linting with Ruff
```bash
# Run linter on all files
poetry run ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues where possible
poetry run ruff check --fix .

# Watch mode for development
poetry run ruff check --watch .
```

#### Type Checking with Mypy
```bash
# Run type checker
poetry run mypy src/

# Check specific file
poetry run mypy src/bot/app.py
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Install all dependencies (including dev)
poetry install

# Run all quality checks before committing
poetry run black .
poetry run ruff check --fix .
poetry run mypy src/
```
